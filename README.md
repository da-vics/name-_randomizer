The code basically randomly prints out the contains of a container in this case a vector... 
it loops through the containers index until the has been reached...
No name should be repeated twice...hence the repeat functions checks to see if an index value has been passed.
The "temp" vector in the code stores the index number that has been generated by the rand() function of the c standard library.
